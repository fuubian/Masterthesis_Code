Caption: Experimental results on the ISIDCM-20 dataset. ``Mean" denotes the average CT value in the selected ROIs. ``AR" denotes the absolute error between the average CT value of each method and that of referenced NDCT in the selected ROIs. The best and second-best performance in each column is colorized by the \textcolor{red}{red} and the  \textcolor{blue}{blue}.\
Text mentions: \subsubsection{Performance comparison on clinical dataset} We follow \cite{10081080} to choose the two most representative ROIs for performance comparison on clinical datasets, as shown in Figures \ref{real1} and \ref{real2}. We calculate the average CT Hounsfield units value and corresponding absolute error with reference images (unpaired NDCT images) as used in \cite{10081080}.  As illustrated in Table \ref{isicdm-20}, quantitative results demonstrate that our proposed method has a closer CT value with the reference image. For example, in ROI-2, the average CT value of our proposed method is -25.15, instead, the second-best result achieved by CCDnet is only -13.91. By observing visualized results in Figure \ref{real1}, it seems that most baseline methods (especially for Noiser2noise and CycleGAN) achieve an unfavorable noise suppression for this very challenging LDCT image with complex and serious noise.\
Question: What is the second-best average CT value in ROI-2?\
Answer: -13.91.

Caption: \label{tab:pkg-times} Comparison of different \proglang{Python} packages for Bayesian optimization. The elapsed time per iteration averaged across the ten runs is given for each package.
Text mentions: However, the time \pkg{NUBO} requires to complete one iteration with a maximum of 2.20s for D) is, on average, higher than for the other packages (Table~\ref{tab:pkg-times}). While this might be important for some areas of optimization, it is negligible when optimizing expensive black-box functions, as these functions are much more resource-intensive to evaluate. Thus, the small number of additional seconds that \pkg{NUBO} requires per iteration is insignificant compared to the resources required to conduct an experiment or a simulation.
Question: Which package has the highest elapsed time per iteration in scenario D, and what is its maximum recorded time?
Answer: NUBO; 2.20s.

Caption: Change area estimates for Tigray region and each zone within Tigray (units are kha)
Text Mentions: Table \ref{tab:change-area} summarizes the area estimates for the four transition classes. We found that cropland gain accounted for $70-160$ kha while cropland loss accounted for $19-79$ kha in Tigray. The stable transition classes accounted for the majority of the area in Tigray: $1,033-1,293$ kha of stable cropland and $3,798-4,054$ kha of stable non-cropland.
Question: What is the estimated range of area for stable cropland in the Tigray region?
Answer: 1,033-1,293 kha.

Caption: \label{tab:heterogeneity}Heterogeneity Analysis 
Text Mentions: Table \ref{tab:heterogeneity} presents the results of a heterogeneity analysis using the sample of users with an organisational affiliation. The results reveal that the adverse effects of the ban on productivity are mainly driven by users who created their profile prior to 2016 and users with 15 followers or less. While the latter could be an indicator for less skilled users, the former results suggests that older users are more impacted by the ban.
Question: Which two user groups are primarily driving the adverse effects of the ban on productivity?
Answer: Users who created their profile prior to 2016 and users with 15 followers or less.

Caption: Experiment 2 Results: Summary of the median, mean, and standard deviation for the epochs required to reach the threshold value across 1000 simulation runs, and a counter of faster convergence runs between models.
Text Mentions: The principal findings of the second experiment are presented in Table~\ref{tab:Iterations}, providing a comprehensive comparison of the epochs required to achieve the predefined loss value of $0.05$, as outlined in Section~\ref{setup2}, between the SCQRNN model and the CQRNN baseline model.
Question: Which predefined loss value is used as the threshold for comparing the epochs required for convergence between the SCQRNN and CQRNN models?
Answer: 0.05.
